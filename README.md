# Case Study: The Equifax Breach of 2017

## Introduction

In September 2017, Equifax, one of the largest credit reporting agencies in the United States, experienced a massive data breach that exposed the personal information of approximately 147 million consumers. This incident has been described as one of the most significant cybersecurity breaches in history, raising critical questions about data security practices and the responsibility of corporations to protect sensitive information.

The breach was the result of a vulnerability in Equifax's web application framework, specifically a flaw in Apache Struts, a widely used open-source framework. Despite the availability of a security patch to address this vulnerability, Equifax failed to implement it in a timely manner, ultimately leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data. The compromised information included names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and in some cases, driver's license numbers and credit card details.

The repercussions of the breach were far-reaching, affecting millions of individuals and prompting widespread scrutiny of Equifaxâ€™s security measures, incident response protocols, and overall corporate governance. As a result, the breach led to numerous lawsuits, congressional hearings, and a substantial loss of consumer trust, highlighting the importance of proactive cybersecurity measures and effective risk management in an increasingly digital world.

This case study aims to analyze the events surrounding the Equifax breach, examine the factors that contributed to the incident, and evaluate the lessons learned for organizations in safeguarding consumer data and enhancing their cybersecurity posture.
